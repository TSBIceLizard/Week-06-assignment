# Week-06

Struggled for all four days with this assignment and did not succeed at finishing it (or even providing it with basic functionality). The largest crux of the issue was that > as because alot of the react app was segmented into separate components as per the assignment requirement, I was not able to figure out how to get each gallery item from GalleryItem.jsx to figure out how to be aware of what entry in the array it is, and then to get what was clicked on to then change the useState of the focusData variable in App.jsx line 20.

Over the christmas period I did not get the opportunity to get a head start with react nor was I able to do any studying due to being busy for it's entirety. I feel that because of this break I ended up getting too rusty with syntax, then having to adapt and translate the JS that I already know into React.js form made it hard to grasp.

I realize that I can import <-> export components between each other but this flow has to work in a certain direction, making it difficult for the app to communicate with itself.

I'm hoping that it will be okay to get an extension for this assignment to give me the chance to properly understand these concepts and submit a fully working assignment, and to see if I can get some help with it.

Thanks for reading.
